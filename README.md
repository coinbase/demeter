# Demeter [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/coinbase/demeter.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/coinbase/demeter)

Demeter is a command line tool for managing security groups across multiple AWS environments. Demeter was written with the following goals:
*  __Stateless.__  EC2 tags are used to store all metadata about security groups.  This makes it easy for collaborators to make changes to security groups.
*  __Variables.__  Provides a flexible way to define global and per-environment variables to be used in all templates.
*  __Multiple AWS Accounts.__  Maintain a naming scheme for your security groups that can be applied to any region or AWS account.
*  __Infrastructure as code.__  My maintaining your security groups using a demeter repository makes them easy to edit and collaborate on.
